### XX NODE INFO - Telegram Bot

With this bot you will be able to receive notifications about node status changes.
If a node you are subscribed to goes offline you will receive a notification on telegram.

#### How to use this bot:

`/start` - Start the bot.

`/subscribe node_id` - Subscribe to a node id in order to receive uptime updates from it.

`/unsubscribe node_id` - Unsubscribe from a node id in order to stop receiving updates from it.


#### Things I will be adding:

- Unity tests. There aren't any :(

- Chose what network you want to receive the updates from. I.e betanet, protonet, etc.

- Retrieve information about node like uptime, timeout %.

#### How to deploy locally

You can run this application locally and create your own bot. You will need to talk to botfather in telegram and create an account in ngrok.io.

I will be elaborating on this topic soon.
